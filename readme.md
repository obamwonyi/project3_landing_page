# The landing page project

* The navigation of the project is created dynamically .
* The section of the project is also created dynamically .
* Each section in the page is highlighted when scrolled or navigated(with the navigation links) into view .
* Each code is Commented properly for a good guide on there function in the project. 
* All the child in the body node are created dynamically . 

## Note : 
The navigation had extra nodes like the header, nav and anchor this is to follow a good css and html practice of creating a good  navigation structure, dispite this the gradual build up with the ul was still implemented . 
When the section is highlighted it pops up with a box shadow
and a background image made from three gradients.

When tested in my platform the website is responsive for 
the following platform : 
* Mobile 
* Tabs 
* Desktop/Laptop

The responsiveness was done with actual device test and not 
by simply shrinking the web window, as shrinking the window does not give the exact reponsiveness.
